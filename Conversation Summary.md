I've been working with you on a React-based application called LiveCharms - an adult content platform for performers and studios. Here's what exists in the project:

**Core Infrastructure:**

- React + TypeScript + Vite setup with Tailwind CSS
- Bolt Database integration with three main migrations (performers, studios, payments schemas)
- PWA capabilities with service workers and manifest files
- Authentication system with login, customer registration, and password reset

**Main Features Built:**

- Dashboard with sales analytics
- Performer management (profiles, content approval, asset uploading, streaming)
- Studio management with financial modules
- Payment processing for models and studios
- Inbox/messaging system with email composer and viewer
- Chat functionality
- Photo and video galleries
- Stories feature (creator, viewer, grid)
- Video calling and streaming capabilities
- Profile management

**UI Components:**

- Sidebar navigation
- Header with notifications
- User menu
- Theme context for dark/light mode
- Help modal
- Install prompt for PWA

The application is fully deployed with a production build in the `dist` folder and includes proper routing, authentication flows, and responsive design.
